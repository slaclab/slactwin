### SLACTWin

SLACTwin is a user interface and database for searching, and
displaying digital twin simulations of beam physics. This project is
just beginning and is under active development. The APIs, schema, and
UI will change.

Currently, SLACTwin supports rendering the output of
[lume-impact-live-demo](https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/lume-impact-live-demo).
[Impact-T](https://amac.lbl.gov/~jiqiang/IMPACT/) is a parallel
particle-in-cell code suite for modeling high intensity, high
brightness beams in rf proton linacs, electron linacs and
photoinjectors.
